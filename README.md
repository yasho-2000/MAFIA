MAFIA stands for Mathematics and Physics Academy! This project is to to create best - in - class android editor and collaboration tool for Mathematics and Physics documents.
 
OVERVIEW

According to Wolfram Alpha, there are 2770 Mathematicians and 13,630 Physicists! If you search for Physics Students, you get 1.427 billion as the answer making it the second largest "religion" in the world and the standard computation time is exceeded if you try to find out number of Mathematics Students making it the largest "religion" in the world!!! You can look at it from another perspective. Consider the top 1000 universities for Mathematics and Physics. Given that there are at least 200 students per university, we are looking at a population of 200000 and 5 times more that number if you look at schools which feed students to these universities. It is 1 Million Mathematicians and Physics Students put together more modest figure than the one mentioned above but nevertheless a sizeable population. A Mathematical Equations editor for Android has a community of 50000 supporting and others for iOS sell 5000 - 10000 copies. Approaching it from yet another angle, there roughly 400000 Mathematics and Physics papers are written using LaTex, which is 20% of the roughly 2.2 Million papers written annually. Assuming that each paper needs at least 2 - 3 authors, we are looking at 1 Million users of LaTex. If LaTex editor is available on Mobile, perhaps more people would use that instead of Microsoft Word or Google Docs. We need a Mathematics and Physics software that will allow Mathematicians and Physicists to edit and collaborate. This will lead to a progression of knowledge and hope you are motivated to build an open source software that will do this. As a next step, I would like machines do Mathematics and Physics alongside people using automated reasoning. I hope I have convinced you of the need for Mathematics and Physics solutions - perhaps not :)
